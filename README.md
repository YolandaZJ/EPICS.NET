EPICS .NET is the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System for .NET Framework 4.0 and above. Written in C#, this control toolkit consists of three sub projects:
* EPICS .NET Library,
* Virtual Accelerator: Demonstrates full capabilities of the library,
* EPICS Simulator

Three of the main components together make up a full control system environment where all the signal algorithms can be tested on the simulator before deployment to the controllers. It is also used as the sole control system for: Turkish Accelerator Center - IR-FEL Project
